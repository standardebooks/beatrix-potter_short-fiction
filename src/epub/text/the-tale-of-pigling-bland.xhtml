				<p>Once upon a time there was an old pig called Aunt Pettitoes. She had eight of a family: four little girl pigs, called Cross-patch, Suck-suck, Yock-yock and Spot; and four little boy pigs, called Alexander, Pigling Bland, Chin-chin and Stumpy. Stumpy had had an accident to his tail.</p>
				<figure id="illustration-526">
					<img alt="Stumpy, the piglet with a very small tail, runs past four hens." src="../images/illustration-526.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>The eight little pigs had very fine appetites. “Yus, yus, yus! they eat and indeed they <em>do</em> eat!” said Aunt Pettitoes, looking at her family with pride. Suddenly there were fearful squeals; Alexander had squeezed inside the hoops of the pig trough and stuck.</p>
				<p>Aunt Pettitoes and I dragged him out by the hind legs.</p>
				<figure id="illustration-527">
					<img alt="Alexander the piglet has wedged himself into the food trough and is squealing at his siblings." src="../images/illustration-527.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>

					<img alt="A piglet lies in a basket on some clothes, next to a large bucket." src="../images/illustration-528.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>Chin-chin was already in disgrace; it was washing day, and he had eaten a piece of soap. And presently in a basket of clean clothes, we found another dirty little pig. “<i>Tchut, tut, tut!</i> whichever is this?” grunted Aunt Pettitoes.</p>
				<p>Now all the pig family are pink, or pink with black spots, but this pig child was smutty black all over; when it had been popped into a tub, it proved to be Yock-yock.</p>
				<figure id="illustration-529">
					<img alt="Yock-yock floats on her back in a large wooden washtub." src="../images/illustration-529.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>

					<img alt="Three piglets munch away at the plants in a vegetable garden." src="../images/illustration-530.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>I went into the garden; there I found Cross-patch and Suck-suck rooting up carrots. I whipped them myself and led them out by the ears. Cross-patch tried to bite me.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-531">
					<img alt="Aunt Pettitoes stands through a field carrying two large buckets. She is wearing a blue and white striped dress, a blue-grey apron, and a blue and white cap. At her feet the eight piglets busily eat from the slop trough." src="../images/illustration-531.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>“Aunt Pettitoes, Aunt Pettitoes! you are a worthy person, but your family is not well brought up. Every one of them has been in mischief except Spot and Pigling Bland.”</p>
				<p>“Yus, yus!” sighed Aunt Pettitoes. “And they drink bucketfuls of milk; I shall have to get another cow! Good little Spot shall stay at home to do the housework; but the others must go. Four little boy pigs and four little girl pigs are too many altogether.” “Yus, yus, yus,” said Aunt Pettitoes, “there will be more to eat without them.”</p>
				<figure id="illustration-532">
					<img alt="Two piglets are being pulled in a wheelbarrow by a farm worker, following the rest in a farm cart through the farm gates. A pair of cows, and a small flock of chickens look on." src="../images/illustration-532.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>So Chin-chin and Suck-suck went away in a wheelbarrow, and Stumpy, Yock-yock and Cross-patch rode away in a cart.</p>
				<p>And the other two little boy pigs, Pigling Bland and Alexander, went to market. We brushed their coats, we curled their tails and washed their little faces, and wished them goodbye in the yard.</p>
				<p>Aunt Pettitoes wiped her eyes with a large pocket handkerchief, then she wiped Pigling Bland’s nose and shed tears; then she wiped Alexander’s nose and shed tears; then she passed the handkerchief to Spot. Aunt Pettitoes sighed and grunted, and addressed those little pigs as follows:</p>
				<p>“Now Pigling Bland, son Pigling Bland, you must go to market. Take your brother Alexander by the hand. Mind your Sunday clothes, and remember to blow your nose”⁠—(Aunt Pettitoes passed round the handkerchief again)⁠—“beware of traps, hen roosts, bacon and eggs; always walk upon your hind legs.” Pigling Bland, who was a sedate little pig, looked solemnly at his mother, a tear trickled down his cheek.</p>
				<p>Aunt Pettitoes turned to the other⁠—“Now son Alexander take the hand”⁠—“Wee, wee, wee!” giggled Alexander⁠—“take the hand of your brother Pigling Bland, you must go to market. Mind⁠—” “Wee, wee, wee!” interrupted Alexander again. “You put me out,” said Aunt Pettitoes⁠—</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-533">

				</figure>
				<p class="continued">“Observe signposts and milestones; do not gobble herring bones⁠—” “And remember,” said I impressively, “if you once cross the county boundary you cannot come back. Alexander, you are not attending. Here are two licences permitting two pigs to go to market in Lancashire. Attend, Alexander. I have had no end of trouble in getting these papers from the policeman.”</p>
				<figure id="illustration-535">
					<img alt="The narrator pulls open Pigling Bland’s jacket with one hand while holding a piece of paper with the other." src="../images/illustration-535.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>Pigling Bland listened gravely; Alexander was hopelessly volatile.</p>
				<figure id="illustration-536">
					<img alt="Alexander prances around the farmyard followed by chickens, while Aunt Pettitoes lectures a serious-looking Pigling Bland." src="../images/illustration-536.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>I pinned the papers, for safety, inside their waistcoat pockets; Aunt Pettitoes gave to each a little bundle, and eight conversation peppermints with appropriate moral sentiments in screws of paper. Then they started.</p>
				<figure id="illustration-537">
					<img alt="Alexander and Pigling Bland walk away from Aunt Pettitoes and the narrator while waving goodbye." src="../images/illustration-537.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-538">
					<img alt="Alexander and Pigling Bland sit on the edge of a field next to a wooded hill, and eat the sandwiches prepared for them from a red and white picnic cloth." src="../images/illustration-538.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>Pigling Bland and Alexander trotted along steadily for a mile; at least Pigling Bland did. Alexander made the road half as long again by skipping from side to side. He danced about and pinched his brother, singing⁠—</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
					<p>
						<span>“This pig went to market, this pig stayed at home,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“This pig had a bit of meat⁠—</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="continued">let’s see what they have given <em>us</em> for dinner, Pigling?”</p>
				<p>Pigling Bland and Alexander sat down and untied their bundles. Alexander gobbled up his dinner in no time; he had already eaten all his own peppermints. “Give me one of yours, please, Pigling.”</p>
				<p>“But I wish to preserve them for emergencies,” said Pigling Bland doubtfully. Alexander went into squeals of laughter. Then he pricked Pigling with the pin that had fastened his pig paper; and when Pigling slapped him he dropped the pin, and tried to take Pigling’s pin, and the papers got mixed up. Pigling Bland reproved Alexander.</p>
				<p>But presently they made it up again, and trotted away together, singing⁠—</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
					<p>
						<span>“Tom, Tom, the piper’s son, stole a pig and away he ran!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“But all the tune that he could play, was ‘Over the hills and far away!’ ”</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<figure id="illustration-539">
					<img alt="A policemen blocks the tree-lined path and checks the piglet’s papers." src="../images/illustration-539.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>“What’s that, young sirs? Stole a pig? Where are your licences?” said the policeman. They had nearly run against him round a corner. Pigling Bland pulled out his paper; Alexander, after fumbling, handed over something scrumply⁠—</p>
				<p>“To 2½ <abbr>oz.</abbr> conversation sweeties at three farthings”⁠—“What’s this? This ain’t a licence.” Alexander’s nose lengthened visibly, he had lost it. “I had one, indeed I had, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Policeman!”</p>
				<p>“It’s not likely they let you start without. I am passing the farm. You may walk with me.” “Can I come back too?” inquired Pigling Bland. “I see no reason, young sir; your paper is all right.” Pigling Bland did not like going on alone, and it was beginning to rain. But it is unwise to argue with the police; he gave his brother a peppermint, and watched him out of sight.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-540">
					<img alt="A dejected Pigling Bland watches as the policemen leads Alexander away down the hill." src="../images/illustration-540.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

					<img alt="Alexander follows the policeman up the garden path, past the cabbages, towards the farmhouse." src="../images/illustration-541.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>To conclude the adventures of Alexander⁠—the policeman sauntered up to the house about tea time, followed by a damp subdued little pig. I disposed of Alexander in the neighbourhood; he did fairly well when he had settled down.</p>
				<p>Pigling Bland went on alone dejectedly; he came to crossroads and a signpost⁠—“To Market Town, 5 miles,” “Over the Hills, 4 miles,” “To Pettitoes Farm, 3 miles.”</p>
				<p>Pigling Bland was shocked, there was little hope of sleeping in Market Town, and tomorrow was the hiring fair; it was deplorable to think how much time had been wasted by the frivolity of Alexander.</p>
				<p>He glanced wistfully along the road towards the hills, and then set off walking obediently the other way, buttoning up his coat against the rain. He had never wanted to go; and the idea of standing all by himself in a crowded market, to be stared at, pushed, and hired by some big strange farmer was very disagreeable⁠—</p>
				<p>“I wish I could have a little garden and grow potatoes,” said Pigling Bland.</p>
				<figure id="illustration-542">
					<img alt="Pigling Bland walks past a signpost down a road towards a wide gate." src="../images/illustration-542.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>

				<figure id="illustration-543">
					<img alt="Pigling Bland runs along a hillside road holding out a piece of paper." src="../images/illustration-543.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>He put his cold hand in his pocket and felt his paper, he put his other hand in his other pocket and felt another paper⁠—Alexander’s! Pigling squealed; then ran back frantically, hoping to overtake Alexander and the policeman.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-544">
					<img alt="Pigling Bland stands on a small grassy path in an open forest." src="../images/illustration-544.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>He took a wrong turn⁠—several wrong turns, and was quite lost.</p>
				<p>It grew dark, the wind whistled, the trees creaked and groaned.</p>
				<p>Pigling Bland became frightened and cried “Wee, wee, wee! I can’t find my way home!”</p>
				<p>After an hour’s wandering he got out of the wood; the moon shone through the clouds, and Pigling Bland saw a country that was new to him.</p>
				<p>The road crossed a moor; below was a wide valley with a river twinkling in the moonlight, and beyond, in misty distance, lay the hills.</p>
				<figure id="illustration-545">
					<img alt="Pigling Bland walks sadly towards a shed under the light of a full moon." src="../images/illustration-545.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>He saw a small wooden hut, made his way to it, and crept inside⁠—“I am afraid it <em>is</em> a hen house, but what can I do?” said Pigling Bland, wet and cold and quite tired out.</p>
				<p>“Bacon and eggs, bacon and eggs!” clucked a hen on a perch.</p>
				<p>“Trap, trap, trap! cackle, cackle, cackle!” scolded the disturbed cockerel. “To market, to market! jiggetty jig!” clucked a broody white hen roosting next to him. Pigling Bland, much alarmed, determined to leave at daybreak. In the meantime, he and the hens fell asleep.</p>
				<p>In less than an hour they were all awakened. The owner, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Peter Thomas Piperson, came with a lantern and a hamper to catch six fowls to take to market in the morning.</p>
				<p>He grabbed the white hen roosting next to the cock; then his eye fell upon Pigling Bland, squeezed up in a corner. He made a singular remark⁠—“Hallo, here’s another!”⁠—seized Pigling by the scruff of the neck, and dropped him into the hamper. Then he dropped in five more dirty, kicking, cackling hens upon the top of Pigling Bland.</p>
				<p>The hamper containing six fowls and a young pig was no light weight; it was taken down hill, unsteadily, with jerks. Pigling, although nearly scratched to pieces, contrived to hide the papers and peppermints inside his clothes.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-546">
					<img alt="A hand holding a lamp is thrust into the hen house, lighting up a host of sleepy-looking grey, yellow, white, and brown hens, and, underneath a shelf, the crouching form of Pigling Bland." src="../images/illustration-546.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<figure id="illustration-547">
					<img alt="An old man holds a large hamper that is resting on the floor. Pigling Bland watches on while standing next to a kettle on a stove." src="../images/illustration-547.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>At last the hamper was bumped down upon a kitchen floor, the lid was opened, and Pigling was lifted out. He looked up, blinking, and saw an offensively ugly elderly man, grinning from ear to ear.</p>
				<p>“This one’s come of himself, whatever,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Piperson, turning Pigling’s pockets inside out. He pushed the hamper into a corner, threw a sack over it to keep the hens quiet, put a pot on the fire, and unlaced his boots.</p>
				<p>Pigling Bland drew forward a coppy stool, and sat on the edge of it, shyly warming his hands. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Piperson pulled off a boot and threw it against the wainscot at the further end of the kitchen. There was a smothered noise⁠—“Shut up!” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Piperson. Pigling Bland warmed his hands, and eyed him.</p>
				<figure id="illustration-548">
					<img alt="Mr. Piperson has taken his shoes off, and thrown one across the room at the wall." src="../images/illustration-548.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Piperson pulled off the other boot and flung it after the first, there was again a curious noise⁠—“Be quiet, will ye?” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Piperson. Pigling Bland sat on the very edge of the coppy stool.</p>
				<figure id="illustration-549">
					<img alt="Pigling Bland sits on one side of the room on a stool, while Mr. Piperson stands working on the other side." src="../images/illustration-549.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Piperson fetched meal from a chest and made porridge. It seemed to Pigling that something at the further end of the kitchen was taking a suppressed interest in the cooking, but he was too hungry to be troubled by noises.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-550">
					<img alt="Pigling Bland sits on a stool in front of the warm fire eating porridge from a blue bowl." src="../images/illustration-550.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Piperson poured out three platefuls: for himself, for Pigling, and a third⁠—after glaring at Pigling⁠—he put away with much scuffling, and locked up. Pigling Bland ate his supper discreetly.</p>
				<p>After supper <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Piperson consulted an almanac, and felt Pigling’s ribs; it was too late in the season for curing bacon, and he grudged his meal. Besides, the hens had seen this pig.</p>
				<p>He looked at the small remains of a flitch, and then looked undecidedly at Pigling. “You may sleep on the rug,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Peter Thomas Piperson.</p>
				<p>Pigling Bland slept like a top. In the morning <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Piperson made more porridge; the weather was warmer. He looked to see how much meal was left in the chest, and seemed dissatisfied⁠—“You’ll likely be moving on again?” said he to Pigling Bland.</p>
				<p>Before Pigling could reply, a neighbour, who was giving <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Piperson and the hens a lift, whistled from the gate. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Piperson hurried out with the hamper, enjoining Pigling to shut the door behind him and not meddle with nought; or “I’ll come back and skin ye!” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Piperson.</p>
				<figure id="illustration-551">
					<img alt="Pigling Bland stands by the side of the farmhouse. A cart with a basket on the back is just visible around the corner." src="../images/illustration-551.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>It crossed Pigling’s mind that if <em>he</em> had asked for a lift, too, he might still have been in time for market.</p>
				<p>But he distrusted Peter Thomas.</p>
				<p>After finishing breakfast at his leisure, Pigling had a look round the cottage; everything was locked up. He found some potato peelings in a bucket in the back kitchen. Pigling ate the peel, and washed up the porridge plates in the bucket. He sang while he worked⁠—</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
					<p>
						<span>“Tom with his pipe made such a noise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He called up all the girls and boys⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And they all ran to hear him play,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Over the hills and far away!⁠—”</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Suddenly a little smothered voice chimed in⁠—</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
					<p>
						<span>“Over the hills and a great way off,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wind shall blow my top knot off!”</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Pigling Bland put down a plate which he was wiping, and listened.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-552">
					<img alt="Pigling Bland looks out of the open kitchen doorway, while wiping a plate with a white tea towel." src="../images/illustration-552.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

				<figure id="illustration-553">
					<img alt="Pigling Bland peers through the doorway. On the wall are a pair of shelves, and to the other side a side table with a basket." src="../images/illustration-553.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>After a long pause, Pigling went on tiptoe and peeped round the door into the front kitchen. There was nobody there.</p>
				<figure id="illustration-554">
					<img alt="Pigling Bland walks up to a closed door and listens attentively." src="../images/illustration-554.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>After another pause, Pigling approached the door of the locked cupboard, and snuffed at the keyhole. It was quite quiet.</p>
				<p>After another long pause, Pigling pushed a peppermint under the door. It was sucked in immediately.</p>
				<p>In the course of the day Pigling pushed in all the remaining six peppermints.</p>
				<p>When <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Piperson returned, he found Pigling sitting before the fire; he had brushed up the hearth and put on the pot to boil; the meal was not get-at-able.</p>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Piperson was very affable; he slapped Pigling on the back, made lots of porridge and forgot to lock the meal chest. He did lock the cupboard door; but without properly shutting it. He went to bed early, and told Pigling upon no account to disturb him next day before twelve o’clock.</p>
				<figure id="illustration-555">
					<img alt="While Pigling Bland eats his bowl of porridge in front of the fire, another piglet peeks in the door behind him." src="../images/illustration-555.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>Pigling Bland sat by the fire, eating his supper.</p>
				<p>All at once at his elbow, a little voice spoke⁠—“My name is Pig-wig. Make me more porridge, please!” Pigling Bland jumped, and looked round.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-556">
					<img alt="Pig-wig, a black pig in a blue dress, stands next to Pigling Bland and gestures at his bowl." src="../images/illustration-556.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>A perfectly lovely little black Berkshire pig stood smiling beside him. She had twinkly little screwed up eyes, a double chin, and a short turned up nose.</p>
				<p>She pointed at Pigling’s plate; he hastily gave it to her, and fled to the meal chest. “How did you come here?” asked Pigling Bland.</p>
				<p>“Stolen,” replied Pig-wig, with her mouth full. Pigling helped himself to meal without scruple. “What for?” “Bacon, hams,” replied Pig-wig cheerfully. “Why on earth don’t you run away?” exclaimed the horrified Pigling.</p>
				<figure id="illustration-557">
					<img alt="Pigling Bland ladles some porridge into a bowl from a cooking pot standing on a three-legged stool." src="../images/illustration-557.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>“I shall after supper,” said Pig-wig decidedly.</p>
				<p>Pigling Bland made more porridge and watched her shyly.</p>
				<p>She finished a second plate, got up, and looked about her, as though she were going to start.</p>
				<p>“You can’t go in the dark,” said Pigling Bland.</p>
				<p>Pig-wig looked anxious.</p>
				<p>“Do you know your way by daylight?”</p>
				<p>“I know we can see this little white house from the hills across the river. Which way are <em>you</em> going, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pig?”</p>
				<p>“To market⁠—I have two pig papers. I might take you to the bridge; if you have no objection,” said Pigling much confused and sitting on the edge of his coppy stool. Pig-wig’s gratitude was such and she asked so many questions that it became embarrassing to Pigling Bland.</p>
				<p>He was obliged to shut his eyes and pretend to sleep. She became quiet, and there was a smell of peppermint.</p>
				<p>“I thought you had eaten them,” said Pigling, waking suddenly.</p>
				<p>“Only the corners,” replied Pig-wig, studying the sentiments with much interest by the firelight.</p>
				<p>“I wish you wouldn’t; he might smell them through the ceiling,” said the alarmed Pigling.</p>
				<p>Pig-wig put back the sticky peppermints into her pocket; “Sing something,” she demanded.</p>
				<p>“I am sorry⁠ ⁠… I have toothache,” said Pigling much dismayed.</p>

				<p>“Then I will sing,” replied Pig-wig. “You will not mind if I say iddy tidditty? I have forgotten some of the words.”</p>
				<p>Pigling Bland made no objection; he sat with his eyes half shut, and watched her.</p>

				<p>She wagged her head and rocked about, clapping time and singing in a sweet little grunty voice⁠—</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
					<p>
						<span>“A funny old mother pig lived in a stye, and three little piggies had she;</span>
						<br/>

					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>She sang successfully through three or four verses, only at every verse her head nodded a little lower, and her little twinkly eyes closed up.</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
					<p>
						<span>“Those three little piggies grew peaky and lean, and lean they might very well be;</span>

				</blockquote>
				<p>Pig-wig’s head bobbed lower and lower, until she rolled over, a little round ball, fast asleep on the hearthrug.</p>
				<p>Pigling Bland, on tiptoe, covered her up with an antimacassar.</p>

				<p>He was afraid to go to sleep himself; for the rest of the night he sat listening to the chirping of the crickets and to the snores of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Piperson overhead.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-562">
					<img alt="Pigling Black and Pig-wig walk hand in hand out of the front door of Mr. Piperson’s house." src="../images/illustration-562.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>Early in the morning, between dark and daylight, Pigling tied up his little bundle and woke up Pig-wig. She was excited and half-frightened. “But it’s dark! How can we find our way?”</p>
				<p>“The cock has crowed; we must start before the hens come out; they might shout to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Piperson.”</p>
				<p>Pig-wig sat down again, and commenced to cry.</p>
				<p>“Come away Pig-wig; we can see when we get used to it. Come! I can hear them clucking!”</p>
				<p>Pigling had never said shuh! to a hen in his life, being peaceable; also he remembered the hamper.</p>
				<figure id="illustration-563">
					<img alt="Pigling Bland and Pig-wig walk away from the farmhouse in the pre-dawn light." src="../images/illustration-563.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>He opened the house door quietly and shut it after them. There was no garden; the neighbourhood of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Piperson’s was all scratched up by fowls. They slipped away hand in hand across an untidy field to the road.</p>
				<p>The sun rose while they were crossing the moor, a dazzle of light over the tops of the hills. The sunshine crept down the slopes into the peaceful green valleys, where little white cottages nestled in gardens and orchards.</p>
				<figure id="illustration-564">
					<img alt="As the sun rises from behind the hill, Pig-wig takes Pigling Bland’s arm and points out town in the bottom of the valley." src="../images/illustration-564.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>“That’s Westmorland,” said Pig-wig. She dropped Pigling’s hand and commenced to dance, singing⁠—</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
					<p>
						<span>“Tom, Tom, the piper’s son, stole a pig and away he ran!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“But all the tune that he could play, was ‘Over the hills and far away!’ ”</span>

				</blockquote>
				<p>“Come, Pig-wig, we must get to the bridge before folks are stirring.”</p>
				<p>“Why do you want to go to market, Pigling?” inquired Pig-wig presently.</p>
				<p>“I don’t want; I want to grow potatoes.”</p>
				<p>“Have a peppermint?” said Pig-wig. Pigling Bland refused quite crossly. “Does your poor toothy hurt?” inquired Pig-wig. Pigling Bland grunted.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-565">
					<img alt="Pig-wig holds the hem of her dress up with one hand, as she skips and dances at the top of the path that leads down into the valley. Pigling Bland has sat himself on a rock on the side of the path and watches her." src="../images/illustration-565.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

				</figure>
				<p>Pig-wig ate the peppermint herself and followed the opposite side of the road. “Pig-wig! keep under the wall, there’s a man ploughing.” Pig-wig crossed over, they hurried down hill towards the county boundary.</p>
				<figure id="illustration-567">
					<img alt="Pig-wig and Pigling Bland have stopped in the road as a horse and cart approaches. The driver is reading a newspaper." src="../images/illustration-567.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>Suddenly Pigling stopped; he heard wheels.</p>
				<p>Slowly jogging up the road below them came a tradesman’s cart. The reins flapped on the horse’s back, the grocer was reading a newspaper.</p>
				<p>“Take that peppermint out of your mouth, Pig-wig, we may have to run. Don’t say one word. Leave it to me. And in sight of the bridge!” said poor Pigling, nearly crying. He began to walk frightfully lame, holding Pig-wig’s arm.</p>
				<figure id="illustration-568">
					<img alt="Pig-wig and Pigling Bland, with walking stick, walk arm-in-arm down the road trying to look as elderly as possible." src="../images/illustration-568.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>

				<figure id="illustration-569">
					<img alt="Pig-wig and Pigling Bland stare up at the cart, next to a big wheel and the end of a trailing whip." src="../images/illustration-569.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>The grocer, intent upon his newspaper, might have passed them, if his horse had not shied and snorted. He pulled the cart crossways, and held down his whip. “Hallo! Where are <em>you</em> going to?”⁠—Pigling Bland stared at him vacantly.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-570">
					<img alt="Pigling Bland and Pig-wig stand by the side of the cart as the grocer, dressed in a white coat and straw hat, inspects their papers. The cart horse has leaned around to look at them." src="../images/illustration-570.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>“Are you deaf? Are you going to market?” Pigling nodded slowly.</p>
				<p>“I thought as much. It was yesterday. Show me your licence?”</p>
				<p>Pigling stared at the off hind shoe of the grocer’s horse which had picked up a stone.</p>
				<p>The grocer flicked his whip⁠—“Papers? Pig licence?” Pigling fumbled in all his pockets, and handed up the papers. The grocer read them, but still seemed dissatisfied. “This here pig is a young lady; is her name Alexander?” Pig-wig opened her mouth and shut it again; Pigling coughed asthmatically.</p>
				<figure id="illustration-571">
					<img alt="Pigling Bland holds up his papers while standing by the horse’s legs. Pig-wig watches on, looking worried." src="../images/illustration-571.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>The grocer ran his finger down the advertisement column of his newspaper⁠—“Lost, stolen or strayed, 10<abbr>s.</abbr> reward.” He looked suspiciously at Pig-wig. Then he stood up in the trap, and whistled for the ploughman.</p>
				<p>“You wait here while I drive on and speak to him,” said the grocer, gathering up the reins. He knew that pigs are slippery; but surely, such a <em>very</em> lame pig could never run!</p>
				<figure id="illustration-572">
					<img alt="Pigling Bland and Pig-wig stand hand in hand, watching the cart drive away up the hill." src="../images/illustration-572.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>“Not yet, Pig-wig, he will look back.” The grocer did so; he saw the two pigs stock-still in the middle of the road. Then he looked over at his horse’s heels; it was lame also; the stone took some time to knock out, after he got to the ploughman.</p>
				<p>“Now, Pig-wig, <strong>now</strong>!” said Pigling Bland.</p>
				<p>Never did any pigs run as these pigs ran! They raced and squealed and pelted down the long white hill towards the bridge. Little fat Pig-wig’s petticoats fluttered, and her feet went pitter, patter, pitter, as she bounded and jumped.</p>

				<p>They ran, and they ran, and they ran down the hill, and across a shortcut on level green turf at the bottom, between pebble beds and rushes.</p>
				<p>They came to the river, they came to the bridge⁠—they crossed it hand in hand⁠—</p>
