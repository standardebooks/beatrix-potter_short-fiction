				<p>Once upon a time there was a Pussycat called Ribby, who invited a little dog called Duchess, to tea.</p>
				<p>“Come in good time, my dear Duchess” (said Ribby’s letter), “and we will have something so very very nice. I am baking it in a pie-dish⁠—a pie-dish with a pink rim. You never tasted anything so good! And <em>you</em> shall eat it all! <em>I</em> will eat muffins, my dear Duchess!” wrote Ribby.</p>
				<p>Duchess read the letter and wrote an answer:⁠—“I will come with much pleasure at a quarter past four. But it is very strange. <em>I</em> was just going to invite you to come here, to supper, my dear Ribby, to eat something <em>most delicious</em>.</p>
				<p>“I will come very punctually, my dear Ribby,” wrote Duchess; and then at the end she added⁠—“I hope it isn’t mouse?”</p>
				<p>And then she thought that did not look quite polite; so she scratched out “isn’t mouse” and changed it to “I hope it will be fine,” and she gave her letter to the postman.</p>
				<p>But she thought a great deal about Ribby’s pie, and she read Ribby’s letter over and over again.</p>
				<p>“I am dreadfully afraid it <em>will</em> be mouse!” said Duchess to herself⁠—“I really couldn’t, <em>couldn’t</em> eat mouse pie. And I shall have to eat it, because it is a party. And <em>my</em> pie was going to be veal and ham. A pink and white pie-dish! and so is mine; just like Ribby’s dishes; they were both bought at Tabitha Twitchit’s.”</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-164">

				<figure id="illustration-165">
					<img alt="Duchess stands on a box to check a bowl on the top shelf of her pantry, which is full with other bowls, boxes and baskets." src="../images/illustration-165.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>Duchess went into her larder and took the pie off a shelf and looked at it.</p>
				<p>“It is all ready to put into the oven. Such lovely pie-crust; and I put in a little tin patty-pan to hold up the crust; and I made a hole in the middle with a fork to let out the steam⁠—Oh I do wish I could eat my own pie, instead of a pie made of mouse!”</p>
				<p>Duchess considered and considered and read Ribby’s letter again⁠—</p>
				<figure class="left" id="illustration-166">
					<img alt="Duchess holds up a raised pie for inspection." src="../images/illustration-166.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>“A pink and white pie-dish⁠—and <em>you</em> shall eat it <em>all</em>. ‘You’ means me⁠—then Ribby is not going to even taste the pie herself? A pink and white pie-dish! Ribby is sure to go out to buy the muffins.⁠ ⁠… Oh what a good idea! Why shouldn’t I rush along and put my pie into Ribby’s oven when Ribby isn’t there?”</p>
				<p>Duchess was quite delighted with her own cleverness!</p>
				<p>Ribby in the meantime had received Duchess’s answer, and as soon as she was sure that the little dog could come⁠—she popped <em>her</em> pie into the oven. There were two ovens, one above the other; some other knobs and handles were only ornamental and not intended to open. Ribby put the pie into the lower oven; the door was very stiff.</p>
				<p>“The top oven bakes too quickly,” said Ribby to herself. “It is a pie of the most delicate and tender mouse minced up with bacon. And I have taken out all the bones; because Duchess did nearly choke herself with a fish-bone last time I gave a party. She eats a little fast⁠—rather big mouthfuls. But a most genteel and elegant little dog; infinitely superior company to Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.”</p>
				<p>Ribby put on some coal and swept up the hearth. Then she went out with a can to the well, for water to fill up the kettle.</p>
				<figure id="illustration-167">
					<img alt="Ribby picks up a furry rug near the open front door of her house." src="../images/illustration-167.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>Then she began to set the room in order, for it was the sitting-room as well as the kitchen. She shook the mats out at the front-door and put them straight; the hearthrug was a rabbit-skin. She dusted the clock and the ornaments on the mantelpiece, and she polished and rubbed the tables and chairs.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-168">
					<img alt="Duchess stands in front of her front door, holding a wicker basket covered by a white cloth. On either side of her grow tall orange irises." src="../images/illustration-168.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
					<figcaption>The veal and ham pie.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>Then she spread a very clean white tablecloth, and set out her best china tea-set, which she took out of a wall-cupboard near the fireplace. The teacups were white with a pattern of pink roses; and the dinner-plates were white and blue.</p>
				<p>When Ribby had laid the table she took a jug and a blue and white dish, and went out down the field to the farm, to fetch milk and butter.</p>
				<p>When she came back, she peeped into the bottom oven; the pie looked very comfortable.</p>
				<p>Ribby put on her shawl and bonnet and went out again with a basket, to the village shop to buy a packet of tea, a pound of lump sugar, and a pot of marmalade.</p>
				<p>And just at the same time, Duchess came out of <em>her</em> house, at the other end of the village.</p>
				<figure id="illustration-169">
					<img alt="Ribby walks down a lane between houses with a basket hung over her arm. Behind her, through an archway, Duchess can seen walking." src="../images/illustration-169.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>Ribby met Duchess halfway down the street, also carrying a basket, covered with a cloth. They only bowed to one another; they did not speak, because they were going to have a party.</p>
				<p>As soon as Duchess had got round the corner out of sight⁠—she simply ran! Straight away to Ribby’s house!</p>
				<figure id="illustration-170">
					<img alt="Ribby comes out of a shop that has a sign that reads “T. Twitchit.” Two kittens play in the alley next to the shop." src="../images/illustration-170.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>Ribby went into the shop and bought what she required, and came out, after a pleasant gossip with Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.</p>
				<p>Cousin Tabitha was disdainful afterwards in conversation⁠—</p>
				<p>“A little <em>dog</em> indeed! Just as if there were no <strong>cats</strong> in Sawrey! And a <em>pie</em> for afternoon tea! The very idea!” said Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.</p>
				<p>Ribby went on to Timothy Baker’s and bought the muffins. Then she went home.</p>
				<p>There seemed to be a sort of scuffling noise in the back passage, as she was coming in at the front door.</p>
				<p>“I trust that is not that Pie: the spoons are locked up, however,” said Ribby.</p>
				<p>But there was nobody there. Ribby opened the bottom oven door with some difficulty, and turned the pie. There began to be a pleasing smell of baked mouse!</p>
				<p>Duchess in the meantime, had slipped out at the back door.</p>
				<p>“It is a very odd thing that Ribby’s pie was <em>not</em> in the oven when I put mine in! And I can’t find it anywhere; I have looked all over the house. I put <em>my</em> pie into a nice hot oven at the top. I could not turn any of the other handles; I think that they are all shams,” said Duchess, “but I wish I could have removed the pie made of mouse! I cannot think what she has done with it? I heard Ribby coming and I had to run out by the back door!”</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-171">
					<img alt="Duchess stands on a red cushioned armchair, next to a sunny window. She’s peering into a cupboard on the wall, that is full of bottles and cups." src="../images/illustration-171.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

				</figure>
				<p>Duchess went home and brushed her beautiful black coat; and then she picked a bunch of flowers in her garden as a present for Ribby; and passed the time until the clock struck four.</p>
				<p>Ribby⁠—having assured herself by careful search that there was really no one hiding in the cupboard or in the larder⁠—went upstairs to change her dress.</p>
				<p>She put on a lilac silk gown, for the party, and an embroidered muslin apron and tippet.</p>
				<p>“It is very strange,” said Ribby, “I did not <em>think</em> I left that drawer pulled out; has somebody been trying on my mittens?”</p>
				<p>She came downstairs again, and made the tea, and put the teapot on the hob. She peeped again into the <em>bottom</em> oven, the pie had become a lovely brown, and it was steaming hot.</p>
				<p>She sat down before the fire to wait for the little dog. “I am glad I used the <em>bottom</em> oven,” said Ribby, “the top one would certainly have been very much too hot. I wonder why that cupboard door was open? Can there really have been someone in the house?”</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-173">

				</figure>
				<p>Very punctually at four o’clock, Duchess started to go to the party. She ran so fast through the village that she was too early, and she had to wait a little while in the lane that leads down to Ribby’s house.</p>
				<p>“I wonder if Ribby has taken <em>my</em> pie out of the oven yet?” said Duchess, “and whatever can have become of the other pie made of mouse?”</p>
				<p>At a quarter past four to the minute, there came a most genteel little tap-tappity. “Is <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ribston at home?” inquired Duchess in the porch.</p>
				<p>“Come in! and how do you do, my dear Duchess?” cried Ribby. “I hope I see you well?”</p>
				<p>“Quite well, I thank you, and how do <em>you</em> do, my dear Ribby?” said Duchess. “I’ve brought you some flowers; what a delicious smell of pie!”</p>
				<p>“Oh, what lovely flowers! Yes, it is mouse and bacon!”</p>
				<p>“Do not talk about food, my dear Ribby,” said Duchess; “what a lovely white tea-cloth!⁠ ⁠… Is it done to a turn? Is it still in the oven?”</p>
				<p>“I think it wants another five minutes,” said Ribby. “Just a shade longer; I will pour out the tea, while we wait. Do you take sugar, my dear Duchess?”</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-175">

				</figure>
				<p>“Oh yes, please! my dear Ribby; and may I have a lump upon my nose?”</p>
				<p>“With pleasure, my dear Duchess; how beautifully you beg! Oh, how sweetly pretty!”</p>
				<p>Duchess sat up with the sugar on her nose and sniffed⁠—</p>
				<p>“How good that pie smells! I do love veal and ham⁠—I mean to say mouse and bacon⁠—”</p>
				<figure id="illustration-177">
					<img alt="Ribby bends down in front of the over and pulls out the pie. Meanwhile, Duchess’s tail and back legs are just visible underneath the table." src="../images/illustration-177.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>She dropped the sugar in confusion, and had to go hunting under the tea-table, so did not see which oven Ribby opened in order to get out the pie.</p>
				<p>Ribby set the pie upon the table; there was a very savoury smell.</p>
				<p>Duchess came out from under the tablecloth munching sugar, and sat up on a chair.</p>
				<figure id="illustration-178">
					<img alt="Duchess watches on while Ribby cuts the pie." src="../images/illustration-178.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>“I will first cut the pie for you; I am going to have muffin and marmalade,” said Ribby.</p>
				<p>“Do you really prefer muffin? Mind the patty-pan!”</p>
				<p>“I beg your pardon?” said Ribby.</p>
				<p>“May I pass you the marmalade?” said Duchess hurriedly.</p>
				<p>The pie proved extremely toothsome, and the muffins light and hot. They disappeared rapidly, especially the pie!</p>
				<figure class="right" id="illustration-179">
					<img alt="Duchess carefully cuts into the pie with a knife and fork." src="../images/illustration-179.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>

				<p>“I think”⁠—(thought the Duchess to herself)⁠—“I <em>think</em> it would be wiser if I helped myself to pie; though Ribby did not seem to notice anything when she was cutting it. What very small fine pieces it has cooked into! I did not remember that I had minced it up so fine; I suppose this is a quicker oven than my own.”</p>

				<p>“How fast Duchess is eating!” thought Ribby to herself, as she buttered her fifth muffin.</p>
				<p>The pie-dish was emptying rapidly! Duchess had had four servings already, and was fumbling with the spoon.</p>

					<figcaption>Where is the patty-pan?</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>“A little more bacon, my dear Duchess?” said Ribby.</p>
				<p>“Thank you, my dear Ribby; I was only feeling for the patty-pan.”</p>
				<p>“The patty-pan? my dear Duchess?”</p>
				<p>“The patty-pan that held up the pie-crust,” said Duchess, blushing under her black coat.</p>
				<p>“Oh, I didn’t put one in, my dear Duchess,” said Ribby; “I don’t think that it is necessary in pies made of mouse.”</p>
				<p>Duchess fumbled with the spoon⁠—“I can’t find it!” she said anxiously.</p>
				<p>“There isn’t a patty-pan,” said Ribby, looking perplexed.</p>
				<p>“Yes, indeed, my dear Ribby; where can it have gone to?” said Duchess.</p>
				<p>“There most certainly is not one, my dear Duchess. I disapprove of tin articles in puddings and pies. It is most undesirable⁠—(especially when people swallow in lumps!)” she added in a lower voice.</p>
				<figure class="left" id="illustration-182">
					<img alt="Ribby stirs sugar into her tea and gestures across the table." src="../images/illustration-182.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>Duchess looked very much alarmed, and continued to scoop the inside of the pie-dish.</p>
				<p>“My Great-aunt Squintina (grandmother of Cousin Tabitha Twitchit)⁠—died of a thimble in a Christmas plum-pudding. <em>I</em> never put any article of metal in <em>my</em> puddings or pies.”</p>
				<p>Duchess looked aghast, and tilted up the pie-dish.</p>
				<p>“I have only four patty-pans, and they are all in the cupboard.”</p>
				<p>Duchess set up a howl.</p>
				<p>“I shall die! I shall die! I have swallowed a patty-pan! Oh, my dear Ribby, I do feel so ill!”</p>
				<p>“It is impossible, my dear Duchess; there was not a patty-pan.”</p>
				<figure class="right" id="illustration-183">
					<img alt="Duchess stands up in her chair with her tongue hanging out. In front of her on the table is the empty pie dish." src="../images/illustration-183.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>Duchess moaned and whined and rocked herself about.</p>
				<p>“Oh I feel so dreadful, I have swallowed a patty-pan!”</p>
				<p>“There was <em>nothing</em> in the pie,” said Ribby severely.</p>
				<p>“Yes there <em>was</em>, my dear Ribby, I am sure I have swallowed it!”</p>
				<p>“Let me prop you up with a pillow, my dear Duchess; where do you think you feel it?”</p>
				<p>“Oh I do feel so ill <em>all over</em> me, my dear Ribby; I have swallowed a large tin patty-pan with a sharp scalloped edge!”</p>
				<p>“Shall I run for the doctor? I will just lock up the spoons!”</p>
				<p>“Oh yes, yes! fetch <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Maggotty, my dear Ribby: he is a Pie himself, he will certainly understand.”</p>
				<p>Ribby settled Duchess in an armchair before the fire, and went out and hurried to the village to look for the doctor.</p>
				<p>She found him at the smithy.</p>
				<p>He was occupied in putting rusty nails into a bottle of ink, which he had obtained at the post office.</p>
				<p>“Gammon? ha! <strong>ha!</strong>” said he, with his head on one side.</p>
				<p>Ribby explained that her guest had swallowed a patty-pan.</p>
				<p>“Spinach? ha! <strong>ha!</strong>” said he, and accompanied her with alacrity.</p>
				<p>He hopped so fast that Ribby had to run. It was most conspicuous. All the village could see that Ribby was fetching the doctor.</p>
				<p>“I <em>knew</em> they would overeat themselves!” said Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-184">
					<img alt="A magpie stands outside an entrance to a barn, with a horse’s legs visible in the background. In front of it is a little blue glass bottle, and it’s holding the stopper in its beak." src="../images/illustration-184.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

				</figure>
				<p>But while Ribby had been hunting for the doctor⁠—a curious thing had happened to Duchess, who had been left by herself, sitting before the fire, sighing and groaning and feeling very unhappy.</p>
				<p>“How <em>could</em> I have swallowed it! such a large thing as a patty-pan!”</p>
				<p>She got up and went to the table, and felt inside the pie-dish again with a spoon.</p>
				<p>“No; there is no patty-pan, and I put one in; and nobody has eaten pie except me, so I must have swallowed it!”</p>
				<figure class="right" id="illustration-186">
					<img alt="Duchess sits on a chair and looks worried." src="../images/illustration-186.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>She sat down again, and stared mournfully at the grate. The fire crackled and danced, and something sizz‑z‑zled!</p>
				<p>Duchess started! She opened the door of the <em>top</em> oven; out came a rich steamy flavour of veal and ham, and there stood a fine brown pie⁠—and through a hole in the top of the pie-crust there was a glimpse of a little tin patty-pan!</p>
				<p>Duchess drew a long breath⁠—</p>
				<figure class="left" id="illustration-187">
					<img alt="Duchess stands in a doorway, with a pie dish held in front of her." src="../images/illustration-187.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
				</figure>
				<p>“Then I must have been eating <strong>mouse</strong>!⁠ ⁠… No wonder I feel ill.⁠ ⁠… But perhaps I should feel worse if I had really swallowed a patty-pan!” Duchess reflected⁠—“What a very awkward thing to have to explain to Ribby! I think I will put <em>my</em> pie in the backyard and say nothing about it. When I go home, I will run round and take it away.” She put it outside the backdoor, and sat down again by the fire, and shut her eyes; when Ribby arrived with the doctor, she seemed fast asleep.</p>
				<p>“Gammon, ha, <strong>ha</strong>?” said the doctor.</p>
				<p>“I am feeling very much better,” said Duchess, waking up with a jump.</p>
				<p>“I am truly glad to hear it! He has brought you a pill, my dear Duchess!”</p>
				<p>“I think I should feel <em>quite</em> well if he only felt my pulse,” said Duchess, backing away from the magpie, who sidled up with something in his beak.</p>
				<p>“It is only a bread pill, you had much better take it; drink a little milk, my dear Duchess!”</p>
				<p>“Gammon? Gammon?” said the doctor, while Duchess coughed and choked.</p>
				<p>“Don’t say that again!” said Ribby, losing her temper⁠—“Here, take this bread and jam, and get out into the yard!”</p>
				<p>“Gammon and Spinach! ha ha <strong>ha</strong>!” shouted <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Maggotty triumphantly outside the back door.</p>
				<p>“I am feeling very much better my dear Ribby,” said Duchess. “Do you not think that I had better go home before it gets dark?”</p>

					<img alt="Ribby stands holding a bucket by the water pump. She’s looking at the ground in front her, where several large pieces of broken white and red pottery lie.

					<figcaption>So there really <em>was</em> a patty-pan.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>“I would not trouble you for worlds; I feel wonderfully better. One pill of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Maggotty⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Indeed it is most admirable, if it has cured you of a patty-pan! I will call directly after breakfast to ask how you have slept.”</p>
				<p>Ribby and Duchess said goodbye affectionately, and Duchess started home. Halfway up the lane she stopped and looked back; Ribby had gone in and shut her door. Duchess slipped through the fence, and ran round to the back of Ribby’s house, and peeped into the yard.</p>
				<p>Upon the roof of the pig-stye sat <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Maggotty and three jackdaws. The jackdaws were eating pie-crust, and the magpie was drinking gravy out of a patty-pan.</p>
				<p>“Gammon, ha, <strong>ha</strong>!” he shouted when he saw Duchess’s little black nose peeping round the corner.</p>
				<p>Duchess ran home feeling uncommonly silly!</p>
				<p>When Ribby came out for a pailful of water to wash up the tea-things, she found a pink and white pie-dish lying smashed in the middle of the yard. The patty-pan was under the pump, where <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Maggotty had considerately left it.</p>
				<p>Ribby stared with amazement⁠—“Did you ever see the like! so there really <em>was</em> a patty-pan?⁠ ⁠… But <em>my</em> patty-pans are all in the kitchen cupboard. Well I never did!⁠ ⁠… Next time I want to give a party⁠—I will invite Cousin Tabitha Twitchit!”</p>
