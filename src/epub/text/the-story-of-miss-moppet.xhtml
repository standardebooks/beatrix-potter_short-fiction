				<img alt="The tabby kitten has green eyes, and she crouches down and stares intently." src="../images/illustration-234.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

			<p>This is a Pussy called Miss Moppet, she thinks she has heard a mouse!</p>
			<p>This is the Mouse peeping out behind the cupboard, and making fun of Miss Moppet. He is not afraid of a kitten.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-235">
				<img alt="The mouse with the green jacket and a red bow-tie stands between a cupboard leg and the green skirting board, and points forwards." src="../images/illustration-235.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

				<img alt="Miss Moppet dives for the mouse and hits the cupboard with her head." src="../images/illustration-236.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>This is Miss Moppet jumping just too late; she misses the Mouse and hits her own head.</p>
			<p>She thinks it is a very hard cupboard!</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-237">
				<img alt="Miss Moppet touches her nose with her front left paw and looks shocked. In the background the Mouse peeks out from behind the cupboard." src="../images/illustration-237.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-238">
				<img alt="The Mouse leans forwards and peers down. His long tail is curved up over his head." src="../images/illustration-238.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>The Mouse watches Miss Moppet from the top of the cupboard.</p>
			<p>Miss Moppet ties up her head in a duster, and sits before the fire.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-239">
				<img alt="Miss Moppet is sitting on a red cushion, with her head completely wrapped in a blue cloth so that no part of it can be seen apart from the ears." src="../images/illustration-239.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>The Mouse thinks she is looking very ill. He comes sliding down the bellpull.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-240">
				<img alt="The Mouse climbs head first down a thick red rope." src="../images/illustration-240.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-241">
				<img alt="The Mouse creeps towards the tail of Miss Moppet, who has still got her head wrapped up in the blue duster." src="../images/illustration-241.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>Miss Moppet looks worse and worse. The Mouse comes a little nearer.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-242">
				<img alt="The Mouse is close enough now to touch Miss Moppet, who is holding her head with both paws, and peeking through a small slit." src="../images/illustration-242.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>Miss Moppet holds her poor head in her paws, and looks at him through a hole in the duster. The Mouse comes <em>very</em> close.</p>
			<p>And then all of a sudden⁠—Miss Moppet jumps upon the Mouse!</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-243">
				<img alt="Miss Moppet pounces off the cushion and onto the back of the Mouse, who is trying to run away. She’s now wearing the duster as a headscarf." src="../images/illustration-243.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-244">
				<img alt="Miss Moppet carefully bundles the Mouse up in the duster." src="../images/illustration-244.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>And because the Mouse has teased Miss Moppet⁠—Miss Moppet thinks she will tease the Mouse; which is not at all nice of Miss Moppet.</p>
			<p>She ties him up in the duster, and tosses it about like a ball.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-245">
				<img alt="Miss Moppet throws the bundle up in the air. Through the slit in the duster the Mouse’s head can be seen." src="../images/illustration-245.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>But she forgot about that hole in the duster; and when she untied it⁠—there was no Mouse!</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-246">
				<img alt="Miss Moppet is holding the unwrapped blue duster in her paws and looking extremely confused." src="../images/illustration-246.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-247">
				<img alt="The Mouse dances with his arms out on top of the cupboard." src="../images/illustration-247.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>He has wriggled out and run away; and he is dancing a jig on the top of the cupboard!</p>
