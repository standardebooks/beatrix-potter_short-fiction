			<p>This is a Tale about a tail⁠—a tail that belonged to a little red squirrel, and his name was Nutkin.</p>
			<p>He had a brother called Twinkleberry, and a great many cousins: they lived in a wood at the edge of a lake.</p>
			<p>In the middle of the lake there is an island covered with trees and nut bushes; and amongst those trees stands a hollow oak-tree, which is the house of an owl who is called Old Brown.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>One autumn when the nuts were ripe, and the leaves on the hazel bushes were golden and green⁠—Nutkin and Twinkleberry and all the other little squirrels came out of the wood, and down to the edge of the lake.</p>
			<p>They made little rafts out of twigs, and they paddled away over the water to Owl Island to gather nuts.</p>
			<p>Each squirrel had a little sack and a large oar, and spread out his tail for a sail.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-36">

				<img alt="Red squirrels stand in a rough circle around the owl Old Brown, who is standing asleep at the base of a tree." src="../images/illustration-37.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>They also took with them an offering of three fat mice as a present for Old Brown, and put them down upon his doorstep.</p>
			<p>Then Twinkleberry and the other little squirrels each made a low bow, and said politely⁠—</p>
			<p>“Old <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Brown, will you favour us with permission to gather nuts upon your island?”</p>
			<p>But Nutkin was excessively impertinent in his manners. He bobbed up and down like a little red <em>cherry</em>, singing⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
				<p>
					<span>“Riddle me, riddle me, rot-tot-tote!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A little wee man, in a red red coat!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A staff in his hand, and a stone in his throat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If you’ll tell me this riddle, I’ll give you a groat.”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Now this riddle is as old as the hills; <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Brown paid no attention whatever to Nutkin.</p>
			<p>He shut his eyes obstinately and went to sleep.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-38">
				<img alt="A sleepy-looking Mr. Brown sits at the base of a tree with a mouse in each claw, while Nutkin jumps up and down next to him." src="../images/illustration-38.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

				<img alt="Squirrels sitting on a tree branch next to a reedbed place nuts in sacks, and lower them down to their cousins below." src="../images/illustration-39.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts, and sailed away home in the evening.</p>
			<p>But next morning they all came back again to Owl Island; and Twinkleberry and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front of Old Brown’s doorway, and said⁠—</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Brown, will you favour us with your gracious permission to gather some more nuts?”</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-40">

				<img alt="Nutkin stands in front of Old Brown and tickles his beak with a nettle." src="../images/illustration-41.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>But Nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Brown with a <em>nettle</em> and singing⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
				<p>
					<span>“Old <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:personal-name">B</abbr>! Riddle-me-ree!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hitty Pitty within the wall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hitty Pitty without the wall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If you touch Hitty Pitty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hitty Pitty will bite you!”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Brown woke up suddenly and carried the mole into his house.</p>
			<p>He shut the door in Nutkin’s face. Presently a little thread of blue <em>smoke</em> from a wood fire came up from the top of the tree, and Nutkin peeped through the keyhole and sang⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
				<p>
					<span>“A house full, a hole full!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And you cannot gather a bowl-full!”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>The squirrels searched for nuts all over the island and filled their little sacks.</p>
			<p>But Nutkin gathered oak-apples⁠—yellow and scarlet⁠—and sat upon a beech-stump playing marbles, and watching the door of old <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Brown.</p>
			<p>On the third day the squirrels got up very early and went fishing; they caught seven fat minnows as a present for Old Brown.</p>
			<p>They paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on Owl Island.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-44">

				<img alt="Nutkin runs on ahead of a line of other red squirrels, all on a grassy path running through a forest." src="../images/illustration-45.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>Twinkleberry and six other little squirrels each carried a fat minnow; but Nutkin, who had no nice manners, brought no present at all. He ran in front, singing⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
				<p>
					<span>“The man in the wilderness said to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“How many strawberries grow in the sea?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I answered him as I thought good⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“As many red herrings as grow in the wood.”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>But old <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Brown took no interest in riddles⁠—not even when the answer was provided for him.</p>
			<p>On the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles, which were as good as plums in <em>plum-pudding</em> for Old Brown. Each beetle was wrapped up carefully in a dock-leaf, fastened with a pine-needle pin.</p>
			<p>But Nutkin sang as rudely as ever⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
				<p>
					<span>“Old <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">B</abbr>! riddle-me-ree</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Flour of England, fruit of Spain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Met together in a shower of rain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Put in a bag tied round with a string,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If you’ll tell me this riddle, I’ll give you a ring!”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Which was ridiculous of Nutkin, because he had not got any ring to give to Old Brown.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-46">
				<img alt="Four red squirrels stand around a china plate, on which is a set of leaf parcels." src="../images/illustration-46.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

				<img alt="Nutkin picks up a robin’s pincushion." src="../images/illustration-47.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>The other squirrels hunted up and down the nut bushes; but Nutkin gathered robin’s pincushions off a briar bush, and stuck them full of pine-needle pins.</p>
			<p>On the fifth day the squirrels brought a present of wild honey; it was so sweet and sticky that they licked their fingers as they put it down upon the stone. They had stolen it out of a bumble <em>bees’</em> nest on the tippitty top of the hill.</p>
			<p>But Nutkin skipped up and down, singing⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
				<p>
					<span>“Hum-a-bum! buzz! buzz! Hum-a-bum buzz!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As I went over Tipple-tine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I met a flock of bonny swine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some yellow-nacked, some yellow backed!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They were the very bonniest swine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That e’er went over Tipple-tine.”</span>

			<p>Old <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Brown turned up his eyes in disgust at the impertinence of Nutkin.</p>
			<p>But he ate up the honey!</p>
			<p>The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts.</p>
			<p>But Nutkin sat upon a big flat rock, and played ninepins with a crab apple and green fir-cones.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>On the sixth day, which was Saturday, the squirrels came again for the last time; they brought a new-laid <em>egg</em> in a little rush basket as a last parting present for Old Brown.</p>
			<p>But Nutkin ran in front laughing, and shouting⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
				<p>
					<span>“Humpty Dumpty lies in the beck,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With a white counterpane round his neck,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forty doctors and forty wrights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cannot put Humpty Dumpty to rights!”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Now old <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Brown took an interest in eggs; he opened one eye and shut it again. But still he did not speak.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-52">

				<img alt="Nutkin dances for the other squirrels and Old Brown. The squirrels look a little worried, and Old Brown looks more annoyed than impressed." src="../images/illustration-53.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

			<p>Nutkin became more and more impertinent⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
				<p>
					<span class="i1">“Old <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:personal-name">B</abbr>! Old <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:personal-name">B</abbr>!</span>

					<span>Couldn’t drive Hickamore, Hackamore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Off the King’s kitchen door.”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Nutkin danced up and down like a <em>sunbeam</em>; but still Old Brown said nothing at all.</p>
			<p>Nutkin began again⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
				<p>
					<span>“Arthur O’Bower has broken his band,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He comes roaring up the land!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The King of Scots with all his power,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cannot turn Arthur of the Bower!”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the <em>wind</em>, and he took a running jump right onto the head of Old Brown!⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>Then all at once there was a flutterment and a scufflement and a loud “Squeak!”</p>
			<p>The other squirrels scuttered away into the bushes.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-54">
				<img alt="Old Brown shrieks with his claws out and beak open wide. The squirrels scatter away from his tree." src="../images/illustration-54.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

				<img alt="The squirrels peek back around the side of the tree. Old Brown can just be seen, standing still with his eyes almost closed." src="../images/illustration-55.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>When they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree⁠—there was Old Brown sitting on his doorstep, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if nothing had happened.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				<em>But Nutkin was in his waistcoat pocket!</em>
			</p>
			<p>This looks like the end of the story; but it isn’t.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-56">
				<img alt="Old Brown stands in the doorway to his house, with one foot on Nutkin’s neck. The other red squirrels in the background look shocked." src="../images/illustration-56.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>Old Brown carried Nutkin into his house, and held him up by the tail, intending to skin him; but Nutkin pulled so very hard that his tail broke in two, and he dashed up the staircase and escaped out of the attic window.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-57">
				<img alt="Nutkin, missing most of his tail, jumps down from the tree and runs off to his cousins in the distance. Old Brown peers out of the attic window after him." src="../images/illustration-57.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

				<img alt="Nutkin, missing half his tail, plays with his cousins on a tree branch." src="../images/illustration-58.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>And to this day, if you meet Nutkin up a tree and ask him a riddle, he will throw sticks at you, and stamp his feet and scold, and shout⁠—</p>
			<p>“Cuck‑cuck‑cuck‑cur‑r‑r‑cuck‑k‑k!”</p>
