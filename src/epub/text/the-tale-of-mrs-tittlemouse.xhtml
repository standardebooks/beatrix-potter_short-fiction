				<p>Once upon a time there was a wood mouse, and her name was <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tittlemouse.</p>
				<p>She lived in a bank under a hedge.</p>
				<p>Such a funny house! There were yards and yards of sandy passages, leading to storerooms and nut-cellars and seed-cellars, all amongst the roots of the hedge.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-416">
					<img alt="In a tunnel underground, Mrs. Tittlemouse opens a wooden door set into the wall." src="../images/illustration-416.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-417">
					<img alt="Mrs. Tittlemouse lies under a pink blanket in a bed built into a niche in the wall. The bed has blue curtains that can be pulled across. On the floor are her brown leather shoes and a red dustpan and brush, while her dress hangs from a hook on the wall." src="../images/illustration-417.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>There was a kitchen, a parlour, a pantry, and a larder.</p>
				<p>Also, there was <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tittlemouse’s bedroom, where she slept in a little box bed!</p>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tittlemouse was a most terribly tidy particular little mouse, always sweeping and dusting the soft sandy floors.</p>
				<p>Sometimes a beetle lost its way in the passages.</p>
				<p>“Shuh! shuh! little dirty feet!” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tittlemouse, clattering her dustpan.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-418">
					<img alt="A black beetle scurries aware from Mrs. Tittlemouse, who is holding her dustpan and brush." src="../images/illustration-418.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

					<img alt="Mrs. Tittlemouse, sweeping the entrance to her burrow, warily eyes up a red ladybird with black spots that is near the end of the tunnel." src="../images/illustration-419.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>And one day a little old woman ran up and down in a red spotty cloak.</p>
				<p>“Your house is on fire, Mother Ladybird! Fly away home to your children!”</p>
				<p>Another day, a big fat spider came in to shelter from the rain.</p>
				<p>“Beg pardon, is this not Miss Muffet’s?”</p>
				<p>“Go away, you bold bad spider! Leaving ends of cobweb all over my nice clean house!”</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-420">
					<img alt="Mrs. Tittlemouse peers out of the end of her burrow at a brown spider with long legs and a blue umbrella." src="../images/illustration-420.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-421">
					<img alt="The spider clings to a thread of silk attached next to the window that Mrs. Tittlemouse has just thrown it out of." src="../images/illustration-421.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>She bundled the spider out at a window.</p>
				<p>He let himself down the hedge with a long thin bit of string.</p>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tittlemouse went on her way to a distant storeroom, to fetch cherrystones and thistledown seed for dinner.</p>
				<p>All along the passage she sniffed, and looked at the floor.</p>
				<p>“I smell a smell of honey; is it the cowslips outside, in the hedge? I am sure I can see the marks of little dirty feet.”</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-422">
					<img alt="Mrs. Tittlemouse creeps down a tunnel holding her covered basket." src="../images/illustration-422.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

					<img alt="Mrs. Tittlemouse brandishes her basket at a yellow, black and white striped bee, which looks worried." src="../images/illustration-423.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>Suddenly round a corner, she met Babbitty Bumble⁠—“Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz!” said the bumble bee.</p>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tittlemouse looked at her severely. She wished that she had a broom.</p>
				<p>“Good day, Babbitty Bumble; I should be glad to buy some beeswax. But what are you doing down here? Why do you always come in at a window, and say Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz?” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tittlemouse began to get cross.</p>
				<p>“Zizz, Wizz, Wizzz!” replied Babbitty Bumble in a peevish squeak. She sidled down a passage, and disappeared into a storeroom which had been used for acorns.</p>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tittlemouse had eaten the acorns before Christmas; the storeroom ought to have been empty.</p>
				<p>But it was full of untidy dry moss.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-424">
					<img alt="Mrs. Tittlemouse peers around a corner of the tunnel at Babbitty Bumble as she walks away." src="../images/illustration-424.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-425">
					<img alt="The bees peek out of the moss that fills the entire tunnel. Mrs. Tittlemouse starts pulling at the moss." src="../images/illustration-425.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tittlemouse began to pull out the moss. Three or four other bees put their heads out, and buzzed fiercely.</p>
				<p>“I am not in the habit of letting lodgings; this is an intrusion!” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tittlemouse. “I will have them turned out⁠—” “Buzz! Buzz! Buzzz!”⁠—“I wonder who would help me?” “Bizz, Wizz, Wizzz!”</p>
				<p>—“I will not have <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jackson; he never wipes his feet.”</p>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tittlemouse decided to leave the bees till after dinner.</p>
				<p>When she got back to the parlour, she heard someone coughing in a fat voice; and there sat <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jackson himself!</p>
				<p>He was sitting all over a small rocking-chair, twiddling his thumbs and smiling, with his feet on the fender.</p>
				<p>He lived in a drain below the hedge, in a very dirty wet ditch.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-426">
					<img alt="Mr. Jackson sits in front of a fire in a rocking chair, while Mrs. Tittlemouse approaches from behind, clasping her paws together." src="../images/illustration-426.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-427">
					<img alt="Mr. Jackson is a large toad. He is wearing brown shoes, brown trousers, a grey waistcoat, and a long purple jacket." src="../images/illustration-427.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>“How do you do, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jackson? Deary me, you have got very wet!”</p>
				<p>“Thank you, thank you, thank you, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tittlemouse! I’ll sit awhile and dry myself,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jackson.</p>
				<p>He sat and smiled, and the water dripped off his coat tails. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tittlemouse went round with a mop.</p>
				<p>He sat such a while that he had to be asked if he would take some dinner?</p>
				<p>First she offered him cherrystones. “Thank you, thank you, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tittlemouse! No teeth, no teeth, no teeth!” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jackson.</p>
				<p>He opened his mouth most unnecessarily wide; he certainly had not a tooth in his head.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-428">
					<img alt="Mr. Jackson sits at a table covered with a white tablecloth and blue and white plates and cups. Mrs. Tittlemouse leans over to offer him a cherrystone from a platter." src="../images/illustration-428.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-429">
					<img alt="Mr. Jackson leans back in his chair and puffs at the thistledown floating around the room. On the table in front of him is a plate with several more." src="../images/illustration-429.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>Then she offered him thistledown seed⁠—“Tiddly, widdly, widdly! Pouff, pouff, puff!” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jackson. He blew the thistledown all over the room.</p>
				<p>“Thank you, thank you, thank you, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tittlemouse! Now what I really⁠—<em>really</em> should like⁠—would be a little dish of honey!”</p>
				<p>“I am afraid I have not got any, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jackson,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tittlemouse.</p>
				<p>“Tiddly, widdly, widdly, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tittlemouse!” said the smiling <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jackson, “I can <em>smell</em> it; that is why I came to call.”</p>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jackson rose ponderously from the table, and began to look into the cupboards.</p>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tittlemouse followed him with a dishcloth, to wipe his large wet footmarks off the parlour floor.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-430">
					<img alt="Mrs. Tittlemouse wipes up wet footmarks with a green cloth, while in the background Mr. Jackson inspects the contents of a cupboard." src="../images/illustration-430.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-431">
					<img alt="Mr. Jackson’s large body fills the tunnel he’s walking down, while Mrs. Tittlemouse follows closely behind." src="../images/illustration-431.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>When he had convinced himself that there was no honey in the cupboards, he began to walk down the passage.</p>
				<p>“Indeed, indeed, you will stick fast, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jackson!”</p>
				<p>“Tiddly, widdly, widdly, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tittlemouse!”</p>
				<p>First he squeezed into the pantry.</p>
				<p>“Tiddly, widdly, widdly? no honey? no honey, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tittlemouse?”</p>
				<p>There were three creepy-crawly people hiding in the plate-rack. Two of them got away; but the littlest one he caught.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-432">
					<img alt="Two woodlice crawl up a wall in between a plate rack and a vase of flowers, while another lies on its back on the countertop." src="../images/illustration-432.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-433">
					<img alt="A red admiral butterfly sits on a bowl of sugar cubes. The bowl white with a pink rim, and is decorated with a floral pattern." src="../images/illustration-433.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>Then he squeezed into the larder. Miss Butterfly was tasting the sugar; but she flew away out of the window.</p>
				<p>“Tiddly, widdly, widdly, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tittlemouse; you seem to have plenty of visitors!”</p>
				<p>“And without any invitation!” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Thomasina Tittlemouse.</p>
				<p>They went along the sandy passage⁠—“Tiddly widdly⁠—” “Buzz! Wizz! Wizz!”</p>
				<p>He met Babbitty round a corner, and snapped her up, and put her down again.</p>
				<p>“I do not like bumble bees. They are all over bristles,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jackson, wiping his mouth with his coat-sleeve.</p>
				<p>“Get out, you nasty old toad!” shrieked Babbitty Bumble.</p>
				<p>“I shall go distracted!” scolded <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tittlemouse.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-434">
					<img alt="Mr. Jackson shies away from Babbity Bumble, nearly crushing Mrs. Tittlemouse behind him." src="../images/illustration-434.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

					<img alt="Mrs. Tittlemouse inspects her stock of hazelnuts." src="../images/illustration-435.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>She shut herself up in the nut-cellar while <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jackson pulled out the bees-nest. He seemed to have no objection to stings.</p>
				<p>When <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tittlemouse ventured to come out⁠—everybody had gone away.</p>
				<p>But the untidiness was something dreadful⁠—“Never did I see such a mess⁠—smears of honey; and moss, and thistledown⁠—and marks of big and little dirty feet⁠—all over my nice clean house!”</p>
				<p>She gathered up the moss and the remains of the beeswax.</p>
				<p>Then she went out and fetched some twigs, to partly close up the front door.</p>
				<p>“I will make it too small for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jackson!”</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-436">
					<img alt="Mrs. Tittlemouse wedges a stick into place across the top of her now considerably smaller front door." src="../images/illustration-436.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-437">
					<img alt="Mrs. Tittlemouse sleeps in her rocking chair, with her paws in her lap." src="../images/illustration-437.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>She fetched soft soap, and flannel, and a new scrubbing brush from the storeroom. But she was too tired to do any more. First she fell asleep in her chair, and then she went to bed.</p>
				<p>“Will it ever be tidy again?” said poor <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tittlemouse.</p>
				<p>Next morning she got up very early and began a spring cleaning which lasted a fortnight.</p>
				<p>She swept, and scrubbed, and dusted; and she rubbed up the furniture with beeswax, and polished her little tin spoons.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-438">
					<img alt="Standing next to a counter top, Mrs. Tittlemouse carefully polishes each of her tin spoons in turn with a yellow cloth." src="../images/illustration-438.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>When it was all beautifully neat and clean, she gave a party to five other little mice, without <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jackson.</p>
				<p>He smelt the party and came up the bank, but he could not squeeze in at the door.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-439">
					<img alt="Several mice, wearing dresses of many different colours, dance while holding their tails up so that they don’t trip over them. In the background, another mouse wearing a burgundy jacket watches them. Through the window we can just see Mr. Jackson’s eye peering in." src="../images/illustration-439.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-440">
					<img alt="Mrs. Tittlemouse passes around acorn-cups to the other mice, who drink from them. One mouse in a green jacket hands another acorn through the window to Mr. Jackson outside." src="../images/illustration-440.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>So they handed him out acorn-cupfuls of honeydew through the window, and he was not at all offended.</p>
				<p>He sat outside in the sun, and said⁠—“Tiddly, widdly, widdly! Your very good health, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tittlemouse!”</p>
