			<p>This is a fierce bad Rabbit; look at his savage whiskers, and his claws and his turned-up tail.</p>
			<p>This is a nice gentle Rabbit. His mother has given him a carrot.</p>
			<p>The bad Rabbit would like some carrot.</p>
			<p>He doesn't say "Please." He takes it!</p>
			<p>And he scratches the good Rabbit very badly.</p>
			<p>The good Rabbit creeps away, and hides in a hole. It feels sad.</p>
			<p>This is a man with a gun.</p>
			<p>He sees something sitting on a bench. He thinks it is a very funny bird!</p>
			<p>He comes creeping up behind the trees.</p>
			<p>And then he shoots—<strong>Bang!</strong></p>
			<p>This is what happens—</p>
			<p>But this is all he finds on the bench, when he rushes up with his gun.</p>
			<p>The good Rabbit peeps out of its hole,</p>
			<p>And it sees the bad Rabbit tearing past—without any tail or whiskers!</p>
