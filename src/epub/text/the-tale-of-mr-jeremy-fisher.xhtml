			<p>Once upon a time there was a frog called <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jeremy Fisher; he lived in a little damp house amongst the buttercups at the edge of a pond.</p>
			<p>The water was all slippy-sloppy in the larder and in the back passage.</p>
			<p>But <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jeremy liked getting his feet wet; nobody ever scolded him, and he never caught a cold!</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-192">
				<img alt="Mr. Jeremy walks through his house, holding a blue and white jug and two matching plates. The floor is covered in water, and a snail has climbed the wall." src="../images/illustration-192.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

				<img alt="Mr. Jeremy walks out of the front door of his house. There are tall flowers and plants on either side." src="../images/illustration-193.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>He was quite pleased when he looked out and saw large drops of rain, splashing in the pond⁠—</p>
			<p>“I will get some worms and go fishing and catch a dish of minnows for my dinner,” said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jeremy Fisher. “If I catch more than five fish, I will invite my friends <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise and Sir Isaac Newton. The Alderman, however, eats salad.”</p>

				<img alt="Mr. Jeremy is digging for fishing bait with a spade. Next to him on the earth is a tin marked “Bait,” and to his right an earthworm is poking out of the ground." src="../images/illustration-194.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-195">
				<img alt="Mr. Jeremy hops across the lily-leaves and flowers, holding his rod in one hand and with a basket slung over his back." src="../images/illustration-195.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jeremy put on a macintosh, and a pair of shiny goloshes; he took his rod and basket, and set off with enormous hops to the place where he kept his boat.</p>
			<p>The boat was round and green, and very like the other lily-leaves. It was tied to a water-plant in the middle of the pond.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-196">
				<img alt="Mr. Jeremy crouches on a lily-leaf, and unties a rope from a leaf stalk that’s sticking out of the water." src="../images/illustration-196.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-197">
				<img alt="Mr. Jeremy stands on his lily-leaf boat, and pushes his way into open water with a long stalk." src="../images/illustration-197.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jeremy took a reed pole, and pushed the boat out into open water. “I know a good place for minnows,” said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jeremy Fisher.</p>
			<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jeremy stuck his pole into the mud and fastened the boat to it.</p>
			<p>Then he settled himself cross-legged and arranged his fishing tackle. He had the dearest little red float. His rod was a tough stalk of grass, his line was a fine long white horsehair, and he tied a little wriggling worm at the end.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-198">
				<img alt="Mr. Jeremy sits cross-legged on his lily-leaf and carefully prepares his fishing tackle. In his right hand he’s holding his fishing rod and line, and in his left a red and white float. Next to him is his tin of bait and his basket. Behind him on a worm is making a valiant attempt to escape." src="../images/illustration-198.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-199">
				<img alt="Mr. Jeremy sits on his lily-leaf with his line dangling in the water. The leaf is tied to his stalk that’s stuck in the lake bed. It has started to rain." src="../images/illustration-199.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>The rain trickled down his back, and for nearly an hour he stared at the float.</p>
			<p>“This is getting tiresome, I think I should like some lunch,” said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jeremy Fisher.</p>
			<p>He punted back again amongst the water-plants, and took some lunch out of his basket.</p>
			<p>“I will eat a butterfly sandwich, and wait till the shower is over,” said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jeremy Fisher.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-200">
				<img alt="Mr. Jeremy sits on his lily-leaf with his legs crossed and his left foot trailing in the water. He is munching a white piece of butterfly wing and looking thoughtful." src="../images/illustration-200.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-201">
				<img alt="A big brown water-beetle has swum up to the bottom of Mr. Jeremy’s lily-leaf. It is holding the end of his shoe between its front legs." src="../images/illustration-201.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>A great big water-beetle came up underneath the lily leaf and tweaked the toe of one of his goloshes.</p>
			<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jeremy crossed his legs up shorter, out of reach, and went on eating his sandwich.</p>
			<p>Once or twice something moved about with a rustle and a splash amongst the rushes at the side of the pond.</p>
			<p>“I trust that is not a rat,” said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jeremy Fisher; “I think I had better get away from here.”</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-202">
				<img alt="A water vole swims through the water between the lily-leaves. In the background, another stands among the reeds." src="../images/illustration-202.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-203">
				<img alt="Mr. Jeremy sits on his lily-leaf with his legs crossed. He is staring intently at the float attached to his fishing line, which is sitting in the water in front of him." src="../images/illustration-203.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jeremy shoved the boat out again a little way, and dropped in the bait. There was a bite almost directly; the float gave a tremendous bobbit!</p>
			<p>“A minnow! a minnow! I have him by the nose!” cried <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jeremy Fisher, jerking up his rod.</p>
			<p>But what a horrible surprise! Instead of a smooth fat minnow, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jeremy landed little Jack Sharp the stickleback, covered with spines!</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-204">
				<img alt="Mr. Jeremy stands up and, bracing himself, hauls on his fishing rod. On the end of it he has hooked a fish that is half his size." src="../images/illustration-204.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-205">
				<img alt="Mr. Jeremy falls back onto the lily-leaf. In his lap is a large stickleback with three spines and a red belly." src="../images/illustration-205.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>The stickleback floundered about the boat, pricking and snapping until he was quite out of breath. Then he jumped back into the water.</p>
			<p>And a shoal of other little fishes put their heads out, and laughed at <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jeremy Fisher.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-206">
				<img alt="Mr. Jeremy sits on his lily-leaf, turned away and looking over his shoulder at the fish behind him who are leaping in and out of the water." src="../images/illustration-206.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-207">
				<img alt="Mr. Jeremy sits on his lily-leaf, with his right leg trailing in the water. From underneath looms the open jaws and eye of a large fish." src="../images/illustration-207.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>And while <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jeremy sat disconsolately on the edge of his boat⁠—sucking his sore fingers and peering down into the water⁠—a <em>much</em> worse thing happened; a really <em>frightful</em> thing it would have been, if <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jeremy had not been wearing a macintosh!</p>
			<p>A great big enormous trout came up⁠—<i>ker‑pflop‑p‑p‑p!</i> with a splash⁠—and it seized <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jeremy with a snap, “Ow! Ow! Ow!”⁠—and then it turned and dived down to the bottom of the pond!</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-208">
				<img alt="The blue and grey dappled trout has grabbed Mr. Jeremy between its teeth, and is diving quickly down into the water." src="../images/illustration-208.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-209">
				<img alt="The upset trout has twisted around to look at the departing Mr. Jeremy as he swims back up to the surface." src="../images/illustration-209.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>But the trout was so displeased with the taste of the macintosh, that in less than half a minute it spat him out again; and the only thing it swallowed was <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jeremy’s goloshes.</p>
			<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jeremy bounced up to the surface of the water, like a cork and the bubbles out of a soda water bottle; and he swam with all his might to the edge of the pond.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-210">
				<img alt="Mr. Jeremy’s head is just poking out of the water as he swims towards a lily-leaf. Behind him bubbles rise up from the bottom of the water." src="../images/illustration-210.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-211">
				<img alt="Mr. Jeremy climbs out of the water and carefully up the bank. He looks a bit shocked, and is only wearing his white shirt." src="../images/illustration-211.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>He scrambled out on the first bank he came to, and he hopped home across the meadow with his macintosh all in tatters.</p>
			<p>“What a mercy that was not a pike!” said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jeremy Fisher. “I have lost my rod and basket; but it does not much matter, for I am sure I should never have dared to go fishing again!”</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-212">
				<img alt="Mr. Jeremy hops down the path towards his house, which is just visible in the distance." src="../images/illustration-212.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-213">
				<img alt="Just as a tortoise and a newt in a morning coat arrive at Mr. Jeremy’s house, he appears at the gate fully clothed in his original red jacket and looking happy." src="../images/illustration-213.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>He put some sticking plaster on his fingers, and his friends both came to dinner. He could not offer them fish, but he had something else in his larder.</p>
			<p>Sir Isaac Newton wore his black and gold waistcoat,</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-214">
				<img alt="Sir Isaac Newton stands talking to Mr. Jeremy. He’s wearing a long grey morning coat, unbuttoned to display his waistcoat with dappled black and gold patterns." src="../images/illustration-214.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>And <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise brought a salad with him in a string bag.</p>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-215">
				<img alt="Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise joins Sir Isaac and Mr. Jeremy’s conversation. He’s carrying a net bag filled with soft lettuce, and is wearing the gold chain that signifies his rank." src="../images/illustration-215.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-216">
				<img alt="All three of the dinner companions sit around a table. Mr. Jeremy is holding a carving knife and fork over a platter on which sits a grasshopper. Mr. Ptolemy and Sir Isaac look slightly worried." src="../images/illustration-216.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>And instead of a nice dish of minnows⁠—they had a roasted grasshopper with ladybird sauce; which frogs consider a beautiful treat; but <em>I</em> think it must have been nasty!</p>
