				</figure>
				<p>Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lucie, who lived at a farm called Little-town. She was a good little girl⁠—only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs!</p>
				<p>One day little Lucie came into the farmyard crying⁠—oh, she did cry so! “I’ve lost my pocket-handkin! Three handkins and a pinny! Have <em>you</em> seen them, Tabby Kitten?”</p>
				<p>The Kitten went on washing her white paws; so Lucie asked a speckled hen⁠—</p>
				<p>“Sally Henny-penny, have <em>you</em> found three pocket-handkins?”</p>
				<p>But the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking⁠—</p>
				<p>“I go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!”</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-137">
					<img alt="Lucie bends down in front of the barn door to talk to a brown hen." src="../images/illustration-137.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-138">
					<img alt="Lucie kneels on a stone stile while looking at the hills in the distance. Next to her are some foxgloves and a tree on which is sitting a robin." src="../images/illustration-138.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>And then Lucie asked Cock Robin sitting on a twig.</p>
				<p>Cock Robin looked sideways at Lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew over a stile and away.</p>
				<p>Lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind Little-town⁠—a hill that goes up⁠—up⁠—into the clouds as though it had no top!</p>
				<p>And a great way up the hillside she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass.</p>
				<p>Lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her; she ran along a steep pathway⁠—up and up⁠—until Little-town was right away down below⁠—she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-139">
					<img alt="Lucie runs along a path between stands of bracken. Down the hillside can be seen the white farm, and in the distance is a valley between big cliffs." src="../images/illustration-139.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-140">
					<img alt="A little stream is running from a hole in the hillside and cascading down. A tin stands by the first little waterfall. The stream is surrounded by green plants, forget-me-nots, and daisies." src="../images/illustration-140.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>Presently she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hillside.</p>
				<p>Someone had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water⁠—but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an eggcup! And where the sand upon the path was wet⁠—there were footmarks of a <em>very</em> small person.</p>
				<p>Lucie ran on, and on.</p>
				<p>The path ended under a big rock. The grass was short and green, and there were clothes⁠—props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins⁠—but no pocket-handkerchiefs!</p>
				<p>But there was something else⁠—a door! straight into the hill; and inside it someone was singing⁠—</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
					<p>
						<span>“Lily-white and clean, oh!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With little frills between, oh!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Smooth and hot⁠—red rusty spot</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Never here be seen, oh!”</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-141">
					<img alt="Lucie has her hands to her mouth as she looks at a small grey door built into a rock. String is tied between some small bare trees next to her." src="../images/illustration-141.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-142">
					<img alt="Lucie has pushed open the door and stands in a hallway, looking slightly apprehensive. To the left of the door is a wooden chair with a purple cushion, and to the right is a wooden chest of drawers." src="../images/illustration-142.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>Lucie, knocked⁠—once⁠—twice, and interrupted the song. A little frightened voice called out “Who’s that?”</p>
				<p>Lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?⁠—a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams⁠—just like any other farm kitchen. Only the ceiling was so low that Lucie’s head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there.</p>
				<p>There was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie.</p>
				<p>Her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat. Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap⁠—where Lucie had yellow curls⁠—that little person had <strong>prickles</strong>!</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-143">
					<img alt="Mrs. Tiggy-winkle is standing on a step so that she can reach the cloth on the table in front of her with her hot iron. On the other side of the table is Lucie." src="../images/illustration-143.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-144">
					<img alt="Mrs. Tiggy-winkle is wiping her left paw on her apron, and smiling. In her other paw she’s holding a basket of linen. Behind her are shelves displaying her best china: white plates, plates painted with birds, and matched pink cups and saucers." src="../images/illustration-144.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>“Who are you?” said Lucie. “Have you seen my pocket-handkins?”</p>
				<p>The little person made a bob-curtsey⁠—“Oh, yes, if you please’m; my name is <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle; oh, yes if you please’m, I’m an excellent clear-starcher!” And she took something out of a clothes-basket, and spread it on the ironing-blanket.</p>
				<p>“What’s that thing?” said Lucie⁠—“that’s not my pocket-handkin?”</p>
				<p>“Oh no, if you please’m; that’s a little scarlet waistcoat belonging to Cock Robin!”</p>
				<p>And she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-145">
					<img alt="Mrs. Tiggy-winkle carefully irons Cock Robin’s red waistcoat while Lucie points at it from the other side of the table. Lucie has taken off her coat, and is wearing a pink dress with a white pinafore underneath." src="../images/illustration-145.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-146">
					<img alt="Mrs. Tiggy-winkle gestures at a piece of cloth patterned with flowers that’s hanging from a drying rack." src="../images/illustration-146.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>Then she took something else off a clotheshorse⁠—</p>
				<p>“That isn’t my pinny?” said Lucie.</p>
				<p>“Oh no, if you please’m; that’s a damask tablecloth belonging to Jenny Wren; look how it’s stained with currant wine! It’s very bad to wash!” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle.</p>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle’s nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire.</p>

					<img alt="Mrs. Tiggy-winkle bends down to pick up the iron that’s been heating in front of her fire." src="../images/illustration-147.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>

				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-148">
					<img alt="Lucie inspects the white pinafore that Mrs. Tiggy-winkle is holding up." src="../images/illustration-148.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>“There’s one of my pocket-handkins!” cried Lucie⁠—“and there’s my pinny!”</p>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills.</p>
				<p>“Oh that <em>is</em> lovely!” said Lucie.</p>
				<p>“And what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?”</p>
				<p>“Oh, that’s a pair of stockings belonging to Sally Henny-penny⁠—look how she’s worn the heels out with scratching in the yard! She’ll very soon go barefoot!” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-149">
					<img alt="Mrs. Tiggy-winkle inspects a pair of long yellow stockings that she’s holding up. They’re obviously made for chicken’s feet." src="../images/illustration-149.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-150">
					<img alt="Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-winkle bend down to look at a light red handkerchief, edged with white lines and covered with white spots." src="../images/illustration-150.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>“Why, there’s another handkersniff⁠—but it isn’t mine; it’s red?”</p>
				<p>“Oh no, if you please’m; that one belongs to old <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Rabbit; and it <em>did</em> so smell of onions! I’ve had to wash it separately, I can’t get out the smell.”</p>
				<p>“There’s another one of mine,” said Lucie.</p>
				<p>“What are those funny little white things?”</p>
				<p>“That’s a pair of mittens belonging to Tabby Kitten; I only have to iron them; she washes them herself.”</p>
				<p>“There’s my last pocket-handkin!” said Lucie.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-151">
					<img alt="Mrs. Tiggy-winkle bends over her washing basket and pulls out two small pieces of white cloth." src="../images/illustration-151.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-152">
					<img alt="Mrs. Tiggy-winkle dips the pieces of white cloth in a blue and white bowl. The hot iron sits next to it on a stand." src="../images/illustration-152.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>“And what are you dipping into the basin of starch?”</p>
				<p>“They’re little dicky shirtfronts belonging to Tom Titmouse⁠—most terrible particular!” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle. “Now I’ve finished my ironing; I’m going to air some clothes.”</p>
				<p>“What are these dear soft fluffy things?” said Lucie.</p>
				<p>“Oh those are woolly coats belonging to the little lambs at Skelghyl.”</p>
				<p>“Will their jackets take off?” asked Lucie.</p>
				<p>“Oh yes, if you please’m; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder. And here’s one marked for Gatesgarth, and three that come from Little-town. They’re <em>always</em> marked at washing!” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-153">
					<img alt="Mrs. Tiggy-winkle, standing on her chair, pulls down a fluffy woollen coat from a washing line for Lucie to look at." src="../images/illustration-153.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-154">
					<img alt="Mrs. Tiggy-winkle stands on a chair on her toes, to pin up some clothes to the lines running across her ceiling." src="../images/illustration-154.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>And she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes⁠—small brown coats of mice; and one velvety black moleskin waistcoat; and a red tailcoat with no tail belonging to Squirrel Nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to Peter Rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the washing⁠—and at last the basket was empty!</p>
				<p>Then <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle made tea⁠—a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie. They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle’s hand, holding the teacup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soapsuds; and all through her gown and her cap, there were <em>hairpins</em> sticking wrong end out; so that Lucie didn’t like to sit too near her.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-155">
					<img alt="Mrs. Tiggy-winkle and Lucie sit on a wooden bench in front of the fire, each with a cup of tea. Lucie is holding a small spoon in her left hand and sipping the tea from the cup in her right." src="../images/illustration-155.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-156">
					<img alt="Lucie has gone outside, and is wearing her red coat again and holding a bundle of cloth. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle has a couple of pieces of clothing over her arm, and is bending down to slide the key under the door." src="../images/illustration-156.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>When they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and Lucie’s pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and fastened with a silver safety-pin.</p>
				<p>And then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the door, and hid the key under the doorsill.</p>
				<p>Then away down the hill trotted Lucie and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle with the bundles of clothes!</p>
				<p>All the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them; the very first that they met were Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny!</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-157">
					<img alt="Peter and Benjamin peek out of the ferns at Mrs. Tiggy-winkle, who hands them back their clothes. Lucie looks on, holding the bundle." src="../images/illustration-157.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-158">
					<img alt="Mrs. Tiggy-winkle hands out clothes to three mice, a sparrow, a blue tit, and Cock Robin." src="../images/illustration-158.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>And she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle.</p>
				<p>So that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile, there was nothing left to carry except Lucie’s one little bundle.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-159">
					<img alt="Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-winkle walk along a path, hand in hand. In the background are hills and a wood." src="../images/illustration-159.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>Lucie scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she turned to say “Good night,” and to thank the washerwoman⁠—But what a <em>very</em> odd thing! <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill!</p>
				<p>She was running running running up the hill⁠—and where was her white frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown⁠—and her petticoat?</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-160">
					<img alt="Lucie stands on the stile, holding her bundle in one hand with her other hand raised questioningly." src="../images/illustration-160.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-161">
					<img alt="A large brown hedgehog runs between some ferns on all fours. She’s covered in spines." src="../images/illustration-161.jpg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
				</figure>
				<p>And <em>how</em> small she had grown⁠—and <em>how</em> brown⁠—and covered with <strong>prickles</strong>!</p>
				<p>Why! <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle was nothing but a <strong>Hedgehog</strong>.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>(Now some people say that little Lucie had been asleep upon the stile⁠—but then how could she have found three clean pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin?</p>
				<p>And besides⁠—<em>I</em> have seen that door into the back of the hill called Cat Bells⁠—and besides <em>I</em> am very well acquainted with dear <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Tiggy-winkle!)</p>
